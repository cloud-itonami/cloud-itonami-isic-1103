(ns maltops.phase
  "Phase machine: the states a malt-liquor (beer) or malt production
  batch transits through.

  State machine:
    :intake -> :malting -> :mashing -> :fermentation -> :packaging ->
    :inspection -> :audit -> :archived

  `:intake` is grain/ingredient receiving; `:malting` is
  steeping/germination/kilning (only meaningful for malt-product batches
  -- a brewery buying already-malted grain skips straight past this
  state); `:mashing` is starch-to-sugar conversion (mash tun);
  `:fermentation` is yeast conversion of wort to beer (never directly
  controlled by this actor -- mash-tun, lauter-tun, and fermentation-tank
  equipment operation remain exclusive to brewery/malthouse staff);
  `:packaging` is finished-product bottling/canning/kegging (beer) or
  bagging (malt), also never directly controlled by this actor;
  `:inspection` is ABV/IBU/diacetyl/microbial/extract-yield/fill-quantity
  inspection; `:audit` is compliance audit; `:archived` is the terminal
  state.

  Each transition can accept a proposal and yield an audit fact.")
